The original name of school was the Washington State Normal School.[3] It was later renamed to the University of Maine at Machias. The prior name is still evident in several locations on campus most prominently on Powers Hall. Through its liberal arts core and distinctive baccalaureate programs, the University prepares students for lifelong intellectual growth, individual success, leadership in a global society, and the advancement of a sustainable environment. The University’s applied research and public services contribute to the improvement of the quality of life and economic development in Downeast Maine.[4]
In April 2016, the University announced that, due to struggles and declining enrollment, it would enter into a partnership with the much larger University of Maine in Orono. The agreement included the sharing of administrators between the universities.
