Education;
American International College was originally established on July 18, 1885, as the French Protestant College by Rev. Calvin E. Amaron, who sought to create an institution of higher learning that would provide the local French Protestant minority with access to higher education. Over the years the college expanded its admissions program to include women, in 1892--the first New England college to do so--as well as minorities who were not of French origin and had immigrated to Western Massachusetts from other parts of Europe and Canada. Today, the college is a thriving multi-cultural institution of higher learning that continues to emphasize its commitment to the local community.
The college offers undergraduate and graduate programs, including master's and doctoral degrees and certificates of advanced graduate study (CAGS). There are three schools which focus on their respective academic areas: the School of Business, Arts, and Sciences; the School of Health Sciences; and the School of Graduate and Adult Education.
The school competes in NCAA Division II, and is a member of the Northeast-10 Conference. The exception is the school's men's ice hockey team, which is a member of the Division I, Atlantic Hockey Association,
AIC also has a college rugby program that was founded in 2009 and began play in 2010.[2] The rugby program is part of the school's athletic department, has varsity status, with rugby scholarships available for students.[3] AIC plays in Division I in the East Coast Rugby Conference. AIC rugby is led by head coach Rob Guiry.
