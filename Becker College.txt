Becker College traces its history from the union of two Massachusetts educational institutions—one founded in 1784 and the other in 1887. The college offers more than 40 undergraduate degree programs[2] including nursing programs, a veterinary science program, and video game design and development programs.

On May 28, 2015, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Becker College signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus to establish the Yunus Social Business Centre @ Becker College. The Centre is established in partnership with the Seven Hills Foundation. According to Yunus Centre and Grameen Healthcare Trust Executive Director Lamiya Morshed, Becker is one of a handful of higher education institutions in the world—and the first in the United States—to establish an officially sanctioned Yunus Social Business Centre. The College's Centre will focus on identifying real-world social problems, creating innovative, self-sustaining solutions to transform lives and communities.[4]

In April 2011, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts designated Becker as the home of the Massachusetts Digital Games Institute (MassDiGI).[5] The Massachusetts Digital Games Institute (MassDiGI) is a statewide center, designated by the Commonwealth, for academic cooperation, entrepreneurship, and economic development across the Massachusetts digital and video games ecosystem.
