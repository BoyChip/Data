Education;
Babson College is a private business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts, established in 1919. Babson's central focus on entrepreneurship education has made it the most prestigious entrepreneurship college in the United States.[3][4][5][6]

It was founded by Roger W. Babson as an all-male business institute. Now co-ed, Babson College offers bachelor's degrees in business administration, and undergraduate students have the opportunity to declare concentrations in more than twenty-five areas of study. Through Babson's F. W. Olin Graduate School of Business, the college also offers master's degrees in business administration, finance, accounting, entrepreneurial leadership, and management. Often referred to as the Entrepreneur's College, Babson is renowned for immersing its students in the entrepreneurial lifestyle and culture. Babson currently offers undergraduates nearly 55 entrepreneurship-related courses. These courses are taught in tandem with traditional liberal arts courses, which represent over 60% of the typical student's schedule. Every entrepreneurship course at Babson is taught by professors who have started, sold, bought, or run successful businesses.[7] Babson currently has an undergraduate acceptance rate of 26%.[3]

Babson College has consistently appeared on the U.S. News & World Report rankings as the number one college in entrepreneurship education for nearly three decades. In 2014, CNN's Money Magazine named Babson the number one college in the country for value, and in 2015, the magazine ranked it second.[8] The Economist ranked Babson second on its 2015 list of best colleges and universities in outperforming earnings expectations.[9] Babson's MBA program has also been ranked number one in entrepreneurship for over twenty years by U.S. News & World Report.
