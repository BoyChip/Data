Education;
The Episcopal Divinity School (EDS) is a seminary of the Episcopal Church based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. The school is in a period of transition, having decided to cease granting degrees from its Cambridge campus after May 2017, with its final graduating class. The Board of Trustees announced on February 24, 2017 that they had "voted to pursue an affiliation with Union Theological Seminary that would create an EDS entity to provide Episcopal theological education and other programs at Unionâ€™s campus in New York".[1]

The Episcopal Divinity School has offered Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Theological Studies, and Doctor of Ministry degrees, as well as a Certificate in Anglican Studies. It has a longtime relationship with Harvard Divinity School that includes cross-registration. The Episcopal Divinity School is a member of the Boston Theological Institute, a consortium of nine Boston-area seminaries and divinity schools that share library and academic resources and allow cross-registration for courses. Since 2010, EDS has shared part of its campus, offered cross-registration, and pooled resources with Lesley University.

Established to train people for ordination in the Episcopal Church, the seminary also trains students from other denominations; since 2011, members of the Metropolitan Community Church can train for ordination in their church, receiving specific instruction on their church's polity.

Known throughout the Anglican Communion for progressive teaching and action on issues of civil rights and social justice, its faculty and students have been directly involved in many of the social controversies surrounding the Episcopal Church in the latter half of the 20th century and at the start of the 21st.
