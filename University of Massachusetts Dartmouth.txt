Education;
The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth (UMass Dartmouth or UMassD) is one of five campuses and operating subdivisions of the University of Massachusetts.[6] It is located in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, United States, in the center of the South Coast region, between the cities of New Bedford to the east and Fall River to the west. It became a UMass campus in 1991 when Southeastern Massachusetts University was merged into the University of Massachusetts system.[7]

The campus has an overall student body of 8,916 students (school year 2015-2016), including 7,295 undergraduates and 1,621 graduate/law students. As of the 2016 academic year, UMass Dartmouth records 392 full-time faculty on staff. For the fourth consecutive year UMass Dartmouth receives top 20 national rank from President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for its civic engagement.[8]

The school also hosts the University of Massachusetts School of Law, as the trustees of the state's university system voted during 2004 to purchase the nearby Southern New England School of Law, a private institution that is accredited regionally but not by the American Bar Association. UMass School of Law at Dartmouth opened its doors in September 2010, accepting all current SNESL students with a C or better average as transfer students, and achieved (provisional) ABA accreditation in June 2012.[9] The law school achieved full accreditation in December 2016.[10]

In 2011, UMass Dartmouth became the first university in the world to have a sustainability report that met the top level of the world's most comprehensive, credible, and widely used standard (the GRI's G3.1 standard). In 2013, UMass Dartmouth became the first university in the world whose annual sustainability report achieved an A+ application level according to the Global Reporting Initiative G3.1 standard (by having the sources of data used in its annual sustainability report verified by an independent third party).[11]
