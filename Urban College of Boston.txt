Education;

Urban College of Boston is a private, non-profit, co-educational, two-year college located in downtown Boston, Massachusetts.[1] The college offers Associate of Arts degrees and certificate programs in 11 other areas.
In 1967 Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) started the Urban College Program to meet the educational, employment and career development needs for adults, in collaboration with major Boston area colleges and universities. The school enabled students to earn academic credits toward undergraduate and graduate school degrees while acquiring job-related skills.

In 1993, the Higher Education Coordinating Council of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chartered the Urban College of Boston as a private institution authorized to grant Associate of Arts degrees in three areas of study: Early Childhood Education, Human Services Administration and General Studies.[2]

In January 1994, UCB enrolled its first degree candidates, both men and women.

In 1995, UCB was granted Candidacy Status for Accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).[3]

In 1998, the affiliation with ABCD was re-cast as a partnership when UCB was granted 501(c)(3) status as a tax exempt non-profit organization. In September 2000, it became a fully independent college, while maintaining a partnership with ABCD.

In October 2001, UCB was awarded full accreditation by New England Association of Schools and Colleges.
