Education;
Bates College (legally incorporated as the President and Trustees of Bates College)[6] is a private liberal arts college in Lewiston, Maine. It was founded by abolitionist statesmen and established with funds from industrialist and textile tycoon, Benjamin Bates. The college is the oldest coeducational college in New England, the third oldest in Maine, and the first to grant a degree to a woman in New England.
At its foundation in 1855 as the Maine State Seminary, it was one of the only colleges in the U.S. to admit black students before the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th Amendment. Its founder, Oren Burbank Cheney, established it as a Free Will Baptist institution, however, it has since secularized and established a liberal arts curriculum. It is located in a former mill town that has a large French Canadian ethnic presence due to migration from Québec and Nova Scotia in the 19th and 20th centuries. The 813 acres (329 ha) campus of Bates College is centered on the Historic Quad in downtown Lewiston near the Androscoggin River. Aside from the 133 acres (54 ha) rural/suburban central campus, Bates maintains an 80 acres (32 ha) coastal center on Atkins Bay and a 600 acres (240 ha) nature preserve, the Bates-Morse Mountain near Campbell Island.[7]
Bates provides undergraduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering. It currently enrolls 1,780 students, 200 of whom study abroad each semester, making it the smallest in its athletic conference. The college offers joint undergraduate programs with Columbia University, Dartmouth College, and Washington University in St. Louis.[8] Unlike typical liberal arts colleges, the undergraduate program requires that all students complete a thesis before graduation, and has a research enterprise that received $1.15 million in grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation in 2015.[9] Bates College's academic program is ranked 10th in the nation for undergraduate teaching,[10] and has top-ten programs in political science, economics, and environmental science.[11][12] According to The Washington Post–a paper that aggregates university rankings from six different publications–the undergraduate program is the 17th best in the United States.[13]
The college is a charter member of its athletic conference, the NCAA Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and competes in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium with Colby and Bowdoin College as the Bates Bobcats. The Tier 1[14] athletic program has graduated 11 Olympians,[15] 209 All-Americans,[16] and currently maintains 32 varsity sports, some of which compete in Division I of the NCAA.
The students and alumni of Bates are well known for preserving a variety of strong campus traditions.[17][18][19] Bates alumni and affliates include 86 Fulbright Scholars;[20] 22 Watson Fellows;[21] 11 U.S. State Legislators as well as 10 State Supreme Court Chief and Associate Justices; 8 members of the U.S. Congress; 7 Emmy Award winners; 5 Pulitzer Prize winners;[22] 3 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries;[23][24] and numerous CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, civil rights leaders, university presidents. The college is home to the Bates Dance Festival, the Mount David Summit, the Stephens Observatory, the Olin Arts Center and the Bates College Museum of Art (BCMoA).
