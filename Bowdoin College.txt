Education;
Bowdoin College (/ˈboʊdᵻn/ BOH-din) is a private liberal arts college located in Brunswick, Maine. At the time Bowdoin was chartered in 1794, Maine was still a part of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.[3] It offers 33 majors and four additional minors, and offers joint engineering programs with Columbia University, Dartmouth College, and Caltech.[4][5]
The college was a founding and charter member of its athletic conference, the New England Small College Athletic Conference–an conference of 11 universities. Bowdoin has a historical connection with two fellow Maine universities, Bates and Colby College in Lewiston, and Waterville, respectively. The three colleges founded the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium, an athletic conference that includes a football and rowing rivalry, academic and inter-library exchange, and shared facilities. Bowdoin has over 30 varsity teams and the school mascot was selected as a Polar Bear in 1913 to honor a Bowdoin alumnus who led the first successful expedition to the north pole.[6] Between the years 1821 and 1921, Bowdoin operated a medical school called the Medical School of Maine.[7]
The main Bowdoin campus is located near Casco Bay and the Androscoggin River; in addition to its Brunswick campus, Bowdoin also owns a 118-acre coastal studies center on Orr's Island,[8] and a 200-acre scientific field station on Kent Island in the Bay of Fundy.[9] In 2017, the college has been ranked as sixth-best liberal arts college in the country by U.S. News & World Report,[10] and the best liberal arts college in the U.S. by Niche rankings.
