Education;
In 1874, The Worcester Normal School was founded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as a teacher-training school. The school started offering Bachelor of Science in Education degrees in 1921. In 1932, the name was changed to Worcester State Teachers College and relocated to its present location on Chandler Street. The university offered its first graduate degree, the Master of Science in Education, in 1952. In 1963, its name was changed to Worcester State College since it had transitioned to include studies in liberal arts and sciences.[2] Worcester State's Graduate School was founded in 1974, and today it offers 31 master's degrees, post-baccalaureate certificates, and advanced graduate study certificates. In July 2010, both the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to grant the school state university status and change its name to Worcester State University. The measure was signed into law by former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.[3] In January 2010, the University was divided into two schools: the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the School of Education, Health and Natural Sciences.

The School of Humanities and Social Sciences comprises the departments of Business Administration and Economics, Communication, Criminal Justice, English, History and Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Urban Studies, Visual and Performing Arts, and World Languages. The School of Education, Health and Natural Sciences comprises the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Computer Science, Education, Health Science, Mathematics, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Earth, Environment, and Physics.
