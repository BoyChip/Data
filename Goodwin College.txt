The college offers a variety of certificate and associate degree programs along with bachelor's degree programs in child study, health science, organizational studies, RN-BSN, and the newest, public safety.
Goodwin College began as Data Institute Business School in 1962. In 2004, the college transitioned to not-for-profit status and was granted accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). In 2008, the Connecticut Board of Governors for Higher Education authorized Goodwin College to offer baccalaureate programs.
In 2005, Goodwin College initiated a major project to construct a new campus along the Connecticut River in East Hartford. The college had purchased riverfront property that was home to a defunct oil terminal, and took steps to redevelop the site in partnership with state and federal environmental agencies and the Connecticut Development Authority (CDA). The site had been designated as a brown field, or contaminated area, by the Environmental Protection Agency, and the college removed 30 large oil storage tanks and conducted soil remediation with the help of state and federal funding.
Goodwin College is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education. The Goodwin College nursing degree is accredited by the National League for Nursing Accreditation Commission (NLNAC).
Connecticut River Academy is located at the same campus as Goodwin College.
