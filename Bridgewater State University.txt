Education;
Bridgewater State University is a public liberal-arts college located in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, United States. It is the largest college in the Massachusetts state university system outside the University of Massachusetts system. The university consists of the main campus located in Bridgewater, and two satellite campuses; one in Attleboro, and one on Cape Cod,[6] which opened in January 2015. The school's sports teams are the Bears, and the school colors are crimson red, black and white.
In the 1950s, many veterans of the Korean War enrolled and proms were the highlight of the year for them.[9] In 1957 the John J. Kelly Gym was built and in 1959 SAT scores were required to be submitted for the first time.[14]

During the 1960s the liberal arts curriculum was introduced.[14] The Ivy Exercises, in which the junior class would form an archway with ivy leaves leading up to the school on graduation day, were dying out. In 1960 Pope Hall was built as an all women’s dorm. Scott Hall was built in 1961 as an all men’s dorm. The Marshall Conant Science Building was built in 1964 and was named after the school’s second principal. In 1967 Shea and Durgin Halls were built as co-ed dorms.[9]

In 1971 The Clement C. Maxwell Library was completed. In 1976 the tennis courts opened and students could enjoy movies on Sundays and Tuesdays for 25 to 75 cents.[9] From 1970 to 1990 the college expanded and enrollment quadrupled. The number of faculty tripled. During this time, Education became the most popular major, and remains so today.[14]

In 1992 the college established the School of Education and Allied Studies and the School of Arts and Sciences. In 1995 the Moakley Center opened. From 1999 to 2002 the college had an endowment campaign to raise 10 million dollars to support academics.[14]

In 2010 Bridgewater State was one of the Massachusetts state colleges that chose to become a university. This would boost its popularity, attract more contributions, increase student applications and enrollment, and give the school a higher profile. On July 22, 2010, the Massachusetts House of Representatives and Senate voted to give the college university status and change its name to Bridgewater State University. The measure was signed into law by Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick on July 28, 2010.[15][16][17] Today the university is considered the "Birthplace of teacher education in America", and has one of the most prominent and distinguished Teaching & Education programs in the country. It has the largest teacher enrollment in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.[14]
