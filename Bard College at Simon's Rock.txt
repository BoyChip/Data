Education;
Bard College at Simon's Rock, more commonly known as Simon's Rock (see below), is a residential four-year liberal arts college located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, USA. Bard College at Simon's Rock is a unit of Bard College, which was founded in 1860 and is located nearby, in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.

The school is an "early college", designed for students to enroll immediately after completing the tenth or eleventh grade, rather than after graduating from high school. Simon's Rock is the only accredited four-year early college to date and still the singular college or university to take this approach with all of its students. It is one of a number of early college entrance programs that provide opportunities for students to enter college one or more years ahead of their traditional high school graduation date. A majority of students transfer to larger institutions after receiving an Associate of Arts degree after two years, although many stay for four to receive a Bachelor of Arts.

The college has received numerous accolades for the quality of education provided to students. The Princeton Review gives Simon's Rock an academic rating of 99 out of 100.[4] U.S. News and World Report ranks Simon's Rock eleventh among baccalaureate colleges in the Northern U.S.[5] Washington Monthly ranked Simon's Rock first among baccalaureate colleges in the nation in 2010.
