Education;
The University of New England (UNE) is a private, coeducational university with campuses in Biddeford, Maine, Portland, Maine, USA, and a campus in Tangier, Morocco. The Biddeford campus sits on 540 acres, the Portland campus on 40 acres, and the Tangier Campus on 3.7 acres. During the 2015–2016 academic year, 12,245 students were enrolled in UNE's campus-based and online programs.[6]

UNE's institutional history dates to 1831, when Westbrook Seminary opened on what is now the UNE Portland Campus. The UNE Biddeford Campus was founded in 1939 when College Séraphique opened as a high school and junior college for boys of Quebecois descent. In 1952, that institution became a four-year liberal arts college named St. Francis College. In 1978, St. Francis College merged with the New England Foundation for Osteopathic Medicine to become the University of New England. In 1996, the University of New England merged with Westbrook College.[7] In 2014, UNE opened a campus in Tangier, Morocco.[8]

UNE is the largest private university in the state of Maine[9] and the largest educator of healthcare professionals for Maine.[10] It is organized into six colleges that combine to offer more than 70 undergraduate, graduate, online, and professional degrees. Known predominantly for its programs in the sciences and health sciences, UNE also offers degrees in the marine sciences, environmental science, business, education, the humanities, and many other subjects. Its College of Osteopathic Medicine is the only medical school in Maine, and its College of Dental Medicine is the only dental college in northern New England.

On February 21, 2017, UNE announced that Dr. James Herbert, formerly of Drexel University, will succeed current UNE president Danielle N. Ripich at the close of her 11-year tenure, effective July 1, 2017.
