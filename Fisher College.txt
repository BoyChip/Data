Fisher also has satellite locations in North Attleboro, Brockton, and New Bedford. The College is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).

Fisher College has attributed its success over the past decade to its historic and world-renowned location, highly educated staff (of which 9/10 hold the highest degree in their field), and independent student body. Fisher College specializes in a number of concentrations ranging from Criminal justice to Fashion.

With a 2015 Student body count of just over 2,500 students (includes Accelerated and Professional Studies students) , Fisher’s small class size grants students an individualized experience with inter-university departments. This access to departments like Career Services, Financial Aid, and Student Involvement and Leadership, is often not possible for larger institutions.
