Education;
Endicott offers over 60 student organizations,[36][37][38] numerous academic honor societies, and varsity, club, and intramural sports. Many students also choose to participate in national community service organizations, including Habitat for Humanity, or volunteer in the local community.[39][40]

In addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate students, Endicott offers a program called Keys to Degrees, which allows single parents to live on campus with their children. The program was launched in 1993 and offers financial assistance, workshops, and a baby-sitting cooperative for this population of students.[41][42] In 2014, the college was awarded a grant to replicate the program across the U.S.[43]
