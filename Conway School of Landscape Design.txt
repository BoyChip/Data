The graduate school offers a unique Master of Science degree in Ecological Design. The school accepts about twenty students each year into its 10-month program.
In 2015 the Conway School opened a new campus in suite 211 of the renovated Mill 180 building in Easthampton, Massachusetts
The mission of the Conway School is to explore, develop, practice, and teach design that is ecologically and socially sustainable. The program puts particular emphasis on communication skills and community building. Students work on real projects with real clients at varying scales, from residential landscaping to urban planning and management of entire watersheds. The curriculum and projects are designed to provide graduates with the basic knowledge and skills necessary to practice the planning, design, and management of the land that respects nature as well as humanity; develop ecological awareness, understanding, respect, and accommodation in the school's students and project clients; and produce projects that fit human use to natural conditions.
